# Maths, Statistics, Analytics and Data Science, and Programming Resources
Running list of necessary analytical knowledge for analytics, modeling, and data science. I have gone through all of these and I have found useful insight in each one. If you are new to the fields I suggest starting on the top and working your way down through the topics sequentially using any reference that speaks to you.
